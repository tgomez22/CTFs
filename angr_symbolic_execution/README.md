These folders contain walkthroughs to CTFs given in the graduate section of Malware Reverse Engineering. The goal of the CTFs was to get experienmce with symbolic execution using `angr` and `Claripy`. Scaffolds of python code were given by the professor, so this code is not entirely my work. Each successive level has less and less scaffolding. As students, we had to fill in theprogram to make it successfully generate the flag needed to solve the level.
